# Horiseon-Social-Solution

**Project Goals**

 The primary goal for this project was to edit the existing homepage for Horiseon Social Solution Service, Inc. 
  to improve its accessibility. The secondary objective of the project was to fix any broken page components and refactor the page's 
  HTML and CSS documents to reduce repetition and improve readability.

**Features**

**Accessibility**

  - replaced title text with "Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc."
  - added alt="[description]" inside img tags (6)
  - added tile=” [title]” inside img tags (6)

**Semantic Changes**

  - Replaced div class with semantic tags for header and footer section
  - Replaced div class containing navigation bar with <nav>
  - changed div of div class="hero" to figure, also changed class="hero" to id="hero" because "hero" seems more like a particular instance rather than a reusable class

**Bug Fix**
  
  - changed footer h2 to h4 
  - updated copyright at bottom to reflect year 2022
  - Adjusted the size of the right text box to be in line with the central content box
